<p>Detects public functions in ViewModel classes that do not follow the naming convention of starting with <code>on</code>.</p>

<p>
    This inspection encourages a clear communication pattern between the View (UI) and the ViewModel in MVVM architecture.
    By enforcing that public ViewModel methods start with <code>on</code>, such as <code>onLoginAction()</code> or <code>onSearchSubmitted()</code>,
    it helps reinforce the principle that the ViewModel should respond to UI events without being tightly coupled to UI logic.

<pre><code>
// Correct
fun onItemSelected(item: Item)

// Incorrect
fun selectItem(item: Item)
</code></pre>

<p>This helps maintain consistency and improves the readability and maintainability of your codebase.</p>
