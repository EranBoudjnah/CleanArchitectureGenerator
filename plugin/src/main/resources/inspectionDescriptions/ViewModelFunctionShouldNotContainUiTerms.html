<p>Highlights public function names in ViewModel classes that contain UI-specific terms like "Click", "Scroll", or "Swipe".</p>

<p>
    This inspection helps ensure ViewModel functions are named in a UI-agnostic way by detecting naming patterns that leak UI layer concerns into the presentation layer.
    It encourages replacing UI interaction verbs with more generic alternatives such as <code>Action</code> to promote cleaner architecture and separation of concerns.
</p>

<pre><code>
class LoginViewModel {
    // Correct
    fun onLoginAction()

    // Incorrect
    fun onLoginClicked()
}
</code></pre>

<p>This inspection supports an auto-fix that renames the function by replacing the UI-related term with <code>Action</code>, e.g., <code>onLoginClicked</code> becomes <code>onLoginAction</code>.</p>
